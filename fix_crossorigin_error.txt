# It is possible that some browsers don't allow to run scripts combined with locally stored data. 
# This is a workaround for Chrome

For OSX, open Terminal and run:

$ open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir
--user-data-dir required on Chrome 49+ on OSX

For Linux run:

$ google-chrome --disable-web-security
Also if you're trying to access local files for dev purposes like AJAX or JSON, you can use this flag too.

-–allow-file-access-from-files
For Windows go into the command prompt and go into the folder where Chrome.exe is and type

chrome.exe --disable-web-security
That should disable the same origin policy and allow you to access local files.
